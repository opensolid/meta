## Currently in progress

  * [`opensolid/scenegraph`](https://github.com/opensolid/scenegraph) package for easily creating physically-based 3D scenes

## Planned

  * `opensolid/parametric` package for polymorphic 2D/3D curves, 3D surfaces, 2D regions, and 3D solid bodies
  * `opensolid/ifc4` to build on top of `opensolid/step` to read and write IFC files
  * `opensolid/ap203` (and/or `ap214`, `ap242`) to read and write automotive/aerospace etc. STEP files
